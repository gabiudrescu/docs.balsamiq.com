{{% alert info %}}**Note:** This transition guide describes the steps to convert BMML files (old format) to BMPR files. Existing BMPR files will work fine in the new version of the add-on.{{% /alert %}}

A new major version of the Balsamiq add-on for Confluence Cloud was released on **TODO**. The new version has projects, symbols, comments, chat, real time collaboration and lots of other improvements.

Here’s a quick, 5-minute video walkthrough for some of the highlights of Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Cloud.

## A New File Format

In the old version of Balsamiq for Confluence Cloud, we stored each wireframe in its own BMML attachment, and only linked to images.

Balsamiq Wireframes for Confluence Cloud introduces a new project file format called **BMPR**: everything that belongs to a project (wireframes, symbols, images, icons) is in a single file, saved as an attachment to your Confluence page. This makes it much easier to link and keep everything together. Learn more about the new plugin [here](../intro/).

In order to take advantage of the new features, you need to migrate the old files to the new project format.

## Migrating Your Mockups to the New Plugin

Once the new plugin is installed, trying to edit a Balsamiq Wireframes macro will reveal this migration dialog:

Clicking on "Migrate to Balsamiq Wireframes" shows this message:

To start the conversion process for the BMMLs on this Confluence page, just click the "Migrate to Balsamiq Wireframes” button:

At the end of the migration process, you will be taken to the new version of the Balsamiq Wireframes editor. Just verify that everything is there, then select **Project > Exit Back to Confluence**.

Once you have returned to the Confluence editor, open the Balsamiq Wireframes Macro Editor and save in order to migrate the macro to the new format.

## Backup Copy of Your Old Files

After the migration your previous v2 wireframe and asset files will be kept as attachments. Once the migration completed successfully you can delete the files or keep them for backup.

## Changes to Licensing and Pricing

Since Connect add-ons must be purchased via Atlassian Marketplace, our licensing model is changing for Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud. Purchasing is subscription-based and requires that you subscribe based on your Confluence Cloud user tier. Full pricing details are [here](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.confluence/cloud/pricing).

We greatly lowered our pricing to make it more affordable to customers under this licensing model. For some customers, purchasing a subscription will be cheaper than our old pricing, and for others the prices have gone up a little due to the Marketplace matching requirement.

However, for those who have a very small subset of their Confluence Users using Mockups for Confluence, we understand that even with these lower prices, because of the matching requirement, our add-on will probably not make financial sense for some teams.

If pricing is an issue due to the big difference between your number of mockups editors and your overall Confluence users, you may consider our web application, myBalsamiq, as a long-term solution for your team. myBalsamiq comes with unlimited users, and [pricing is by active project](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#myb).

We don't have a specific integration between Confluence and myBalsamiq, but there are ways to [use the products together](https://support.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/mybandatlassian/).

We're here to help you figure out which option is best for your team!  [Contact us](https://balsamiq.com/company/contact/#/s/m4c)!

## Customers with Active or Recently Expired Maintenance for Mockups for Confluence

If the maintenance on your Mockups for Confluence license was current or recently expired as of June 20, 2016, we migrated your license to Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud for you (we emailed details to your billing and technical contacts on June 9, 2016).

We of course will be honoring the maintenance time you already purchased.

On June 20, 2016 Altlassian installed Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud in your Cloud instance. You'll be given a free legacy plan in Marketplace equal the maintenance time period you purchased from Balsamiq plus an additional 6 months to make the transition to the new pricing easier (in some instances, the subscription may temporarily appear as a trial.) All of your users will have access to use Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud, even if you only paid for a subset of users to use the add-on. This $0 legacy plan will appear on your monthly or annual Marketplace bill.

At the end of your free legacy time, you'll need to decide if you would like to continue to use the add-on. If you chose to continue, after your legacy plan has ended your Confluence Administrator can start the regular subscription by selecting "Free Trial."  You'll begin with the regular [30 day trial period](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.confluence/cloud/installation) before the automatic renewals begin.

If you chose not to start a subscription, but keep the add-on installed, you won't be able to edit or create new mockups, but you'll still be able to view any existing mockups.

If pricing is the reason you could not continue after the legacy period, let us know! We may have other product options that will work for your team.

## Customers with Expired Maintenance for Mockups for Confluence

If you have not kept up the maintenance on your Mockups for Confluence license, but left the plugin enabled, you may have users who were still using Mockups for Confluence from time to time.

In the old version of the add-on, if you have expired maintenance you are still able to use the add-on, with a EULA violation warning, to give you time to complete your renewal.

As Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud is based on Marketplace's automatic renewal subscription model, you will be required to have a paid subscription to use the add-on once your 30 day trial ends.

We retired the old version of the plugin in July 2016. If you wish to use our add-on, you'll need to start a [30 day trial](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.confluence/cloud/installation) and subscribe to Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud.

As always, if you have any questions, concerns, or problems, we're here to help! [Contact us](https://balsamiq.com/company/contact/#/s/m4c)!
