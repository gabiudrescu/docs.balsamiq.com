## Installing Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive

Installing Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive can be done from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/balsamiq-wireframes-free/imbfadckkgblfbkinjejdeobpfbcopgb), just like any other Google Drive app.

After the installation, please make sure that Balsamiq Wireframes is [set as the default app](../installing/#setting-balsamiq-wireframes-as-the-default-app-for-balsamiq-files) for Balsamiq files.

If you have the previous version installed (Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive), we suggest to [uninstall it](/google-drive/b3/installing/#uninstalling) and enjoy the features and UI of the new app.

## Migrating Your Wireframes to the New Plugin

You can easily migrate any Balsamiq file to the new format by opening it with the new app.

Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive uses the same file format as the previous version of the add-on (BMPR) but it introduces new features that require an upgrade of the BMPR file format.

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** The new BMPR format is compatible with Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop, so you could continue to use both without losing any data.{{% /alert %}}

## Backup Copy of the Previous BMPR File

During the migration process, a copy of the previous version of the BMPR file is saved as a backup. In case you need to retrieve it, see the [downgrading section](../transition/#downgrading) below.

## Licensing and Pricing

Balsamiq Wireframes for Google Drive uses the same licensing and pricing model as Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive, so no migration is needed! Sweet!
